# Abstract  
Landscape connectivity is a factor that influences ecosystemsâ€™ species composition and survival. The alteration of habitat through urbanization inevitably impacts the connectivity of the landscape. We investigate how connectivity and presence of surrounding habitats impacts species richness, Shannon diversity, and estimated abundance of Odonata across the urban landscape of Ottawa, Canada. We surveyed 41 human-constructed stormwater ponds and 8 natural ponds and recorded abundances of all Odonate species. Using land cover data provided by the City of Ottawa, we calculated the number of surrounding habitats around each study pond and the connectivity of the landscape at two different spatial scales. Spatial scales of 300 m and 900 m were chosen following a systematic literature review assessing dispersal distances of dragonflies and damselflies. We found that lower levels of connectivity and number of surrounding habitats negatively impacts the estimated abundances and species richness of dragonflies (p-values < 0.01, R2 = 0.18-0.70). Damselflies had only one significant relationship, which showed lower levels of connectivity increasing species richness (p-value = 0.02, R2 = 0.11). Further, we found that natural ponds had significantly higher levels of connectivity and surrounding habitats at both spatial scales when compared to man-made stormwater ponds. Our research highlights the impact that decreased connectivity can have on the species richness and estimated abundance of dragonflies in cities. We recommend intentional planning of urban stormwater pond networks, with individual ponds acting as stepping stones and the strategic inclusion of low resistance land cover types across the urban landscape.
